title: 'Module Configuration and the Setup Skill'
description: How BMad modules handle user configuration through a setup skill, when to use configuration vs. alternatives, and how to register with the help system
---

Every BMad module can include a **setup skill** that collects user preferences and registers the module's capabilities with the help system. The BMad Builder module's own setup skill (`bmad-builder-setup`) is the reference implementation.

## When You Need Configuration

Most modules should not need configuration at all. Before adding configurable values, consider whether a simpler alternative exists.

| Approach              | When to Use                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sensible defaults** | The variable has one clearly correct answer for most users that could be overridden or updated by the specific skill that needs it the first time it runs |
| **Agent memory**      | Your module follows the agent pattern and the agent can learn preferences through conversation                                                            |
| **Configuration**     | The value genuinely varies across projects and cannot be inferred at runtime                                                                              |

:::tip[Standalone Skills and Agents]
If you are building a standalone agent or skill — not a multi-capability module — the setup skill overhead is not worth it. A concise overview section at the top of your SKILL.md body, clear comments in script headers, and `--help` flags on any CLI tools give users everything they need to discover and use the skill.

## What the Setup Skill Does

A setup skill serves two purposes:

| Purpose               | What Happens                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Configuration**     | Collects user preferences and writes them to shared config files                          |
| **Help registration** | Adds the module's capabilities to the project-wide help system so users can discover them |

## Configuration Files

Setup skills write to three files in `{project-root}/_bmad/`:

| File               | Scope                    | Contains                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config.yaml`      | Shared, committed to git | Core settings at root level, plus a section per module with metadata and module-specific values |
| `config.user.yaml` | Personal, gitignored     | User-only settings like `user_name` and `communication_language`                                |
| `module-help.csv`  | Shared, committed to git | One row per capability the module exposes                                                       |

Core settings (like `output_folder` and `document_output_language`) live at the root of `config.yaml` and are shared across all modules. Each module also gets its own section keyed by its module code.

## The module.yaml File

Each module declares its identity and configurable variables in an `assets/module.yaml` inside the setup skill. This file drives both the prompts shown to the user and the values written to config.

```yaml
code: mymod
name: 'My Module'
description: 'What this module does'
module_version: 1.0.0
default_selected: false
module_greeting: >
  Welcome message shown after setup completes.

my_output_folder:
  prompt: 'Where should output be saved?'
  default: '{project-root}/_bmad-output/my-module'
  result: '{project-root}/{value}'
```

Variables with a `prompt` field are presented to the user during setup. The `default` value is used when the user accepts defaults. Adding `user_setting: true` to a variable routes it to `config.user.yaml` instead of the shared config.

:::caution[Literal Token]
`{project-root}` is a literal token in config values. Never substitute it with an actual path. It signals to the consuming tool that the value is relative to the project root.
:::

## Help Registration Without Configuration

You may not need any configurable values but still want to register your module with the help system. This is worth doing when:

- The skill description in SKILL.md frontmatter cannot fully convey what the module offers while staying concise
- You want to express capability sequencing, phase constraints, or other metadata the CSV supports
- An agent has many internal capabilities that users should be able to discover
- Your module has more than about three distinct things it can do

For simpler cases, these alternatives are often sufficient:

| Alternative                   | What It Provides                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SKILL.md overview section** | A concise summary at the top of the skill body — the `--help` system scans this section to present user-facing help, so keep it succinct |
| **Script header comments**    | Describe purpose, usage, and flags at the top of each script                                                                             |

If these cover your discoverability needs, you can skip the setup skill entirely.

## The module-help.csv File

The CSV asset registers the module's capabilities with the help system. Each row describes one capability that users can discover and invoke.

```csv
module,skill,display-name,menu-code,description,action,args,phase,after,before,required,output-location,outputs
mymod,my-skill,My Skill,MS,"Does something useful.",build-process,,anytime,,,false,,
```

When the setup skill runs, it merges these rows into the project-wide `_bmad/module-help.csv`, replacing any existing rows for this module. This is how users find your module's commands through the help system.

## Anti-Zombie Pattern

Both merge scripts use an anti-zombie pattern: before writing new values for a module, they remove all existing entries for that module's code. This prevents stale configuration or help entries from persisting across module updates. Running setup a second time is always safe.

## Legacy Directory Cleanup

After config data is migrated and individual files are cleaned up by the merge scripts, a separate cleanup step removes the installer's per-module directory trees from `_bmad/`. These directories contain skill files that are already installed at `.claude/skills/` — they are redundant once the config has been consolidated.

Before removing any directory, the cleanup script verifies that every skill it contains exists at the installed location. Directories without skills (like `_config/`) are removed directly. The script is idempotent — running setup again after cleanup is safe.

## Design Guidance

Configuration is for **basic, project-level settings** — output folders, language preferences, feature toggles. Keep the number of configurable values small.

| Pattern                | Configuration Role                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent pattern**      | Prefer agent memory for per-user preferences. Use config only for values that must be shared across the project |
| **Workflow pattern**   | Use config for output locations and behavior switches that vary across projects                                 |
| **Skill-only pattern** | Use config sparingly. If the skill works with sensible defaults, skip config entirely                           |

Extensive workflow customization — step overrides, conditional branching, template selection — is a separate concern and will be covered in a dedicated document.

## Creating a Module with the Module Builder

The **Module Builder** (`bmad-module-builder`) automates module creation. It offers three capabilities:

| Capability          | Menu Code | What It Does                                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ideate Module**   | IM        | Brainstorm and plan a module through facilitative discovery — produces a plan document |
| **Create Module**   | CM        | Scaffold a setup skill into an existing folder of built skills                         |
| **Validate Module** | VM        | Check that a module's setup skill is complete, accurate, and properly registered       |

**Typical workflow:**

1. Run **Ideate Module (IM)** to brainstorm and plan your module
2. Build each skill using the **Agent Builder (BA)** or **Workflow Builder (BW)**
3. Run **Create Module (CM)** to scaffold the setup skill into your skills folder
4. Run **Validate Module (VM)** to verify everything is wired correctly

The Create Module path reads every skill in your folder, walks you through defining the module identity and capability entries, then generates a complete setup skill with `module.yaml`, `module-help.csv`, and all supporting scripts.

See **[What Are Modules](/explanation/what-are-modules.md)** for concepts and architecture decisions, or the **[Builder Commands Reference](/reference/builder-commands.md)** for detailed capability documentation.
