title: 'What Are BMad Workflows?'
description: How workflows guide users through structured processes, how they differ from agents and simple skills, and when to build one

BMad Workflows are skills that guide users through a **structured process** to produce a specific output. They do most of the heavy lifting in the BMad ecosystem. Focused, composable, and generally stateless.

## What Makes a Workflow a Workflow

Like agents, workflows are ultimately skill files. The difference is in emphasis: workflows prioritize **getting to an outcome** over maintaining a persistent identity.

| Trait       | Workflow                                           | Agent                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**    | Complete a defined process and produce an artifact | Be an ongoing conversational partner  |
| **Persona** | Minimal, enough to facilitate a good conversation | Central to the experience             |
| **Memory**  | Generally stateless between sessions               | Persistent sidecar memory             |
| **Scope**   | All steps serve one cohesive purpose               | Can span loosely related capabilities |

## Workflow Types

The BMad Builder classifies workflows into three tiers based on complexity.

| Type                 | Description                                                                                          | Example                                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Utility**   | A single-purpose tool that does one thing well                                                       | Validate a schema, convert a file format                                      |
| **Simple Workflow**  | A short guided process with a few sequential steps                                                   | Create a quick tech spec                                                      |
| **Complex Workflow** | A multi-stage process with branching paths, progressive disclosure, and potentially multiple outputs | Create and manage PRDs (covering create, edit, validate, convert, and polish) |

:::tip[Start Simple]
Most ideas start as a Simple Utility or Simple Workflow. Graduate to Complex only when you genuinely need branching paths or multiple related operations in one skill.

## Progressive Disclosure

Complex workflows use **progressive disclosure** to handle multiple operations within a single skill. Rather than building five separate skills for create, edit, validate, convert, and polish, you build one workflow that detects the user's intent (from how they talk to it or what arguments they pass) and routes internally to the right path.

This is the same pattern that powers BMad's own multi-capability agents and workflows. It keeps the user's experience simple while the skill handles routing behind the scenes.

## YOLO Mode and Guided Mode

Both the Agent Builder and the Workflow Builder support two interaction styles when creating skills.

| Mode       | How It Works                                                                                            | Best For                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **YOLO**   | You brain-dump your idea; the builder guesses its way to a finished skill, asking only when truly stuck | Quick prototypes, experienced builders    |
| **Guided** | The builder walks you through decisions, clarifies ambiguities, and ensures nothing is overlooked       | Production workflows, first-time builders |

Guided mode is no longer the slow multi-step process of earlier BMad versions. It is conversational and adaptive, but produces significantly better results than YOLO for complex workflows.

## Headless (Autonomous) Mode

Like agents, workflows can support a **Headless Mode**. When invoked headless (through a scheduler, orchestrator, or another skill) the workflow skips interactive prompts and completes its process end-to-end without waiting for user input.

## When to Build a Workflow vs. an Agent

| Choose a Workflow When                | Choose an Agent When                         |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| The process has a clear start and end | The user will return to it across sessions   |
| No need to remember past interactions | Remembering context adds value               |
| All steps serve one cohesive goal     | Capabilities are loosely related             |
| You want a composable building block  | You want a persistent conversational partner |

Workflows are also excellent as the **internal capabilities** of an agent. Build the workflow first, then wrap it in an agent if you need persona and memory on top.

## Building Workflows

The **BMad Workflow Builder** (`bmad-workflow-builder`) uses the same six-phase conversational discovery as the Agent Builder (intent, classification, requirements, drafting, building, and quality optimization) and produces a ready-to-use skill folder.

See the [Builder Commands Reference](/reference/builder-commands.md) for details on the build process phases and capabilities.
