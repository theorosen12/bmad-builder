# BMad Builder - A BMad Method EcoSystem Module

**Build More, Architect Dreams.**

## The Dream

What if your AI remembered everything? A fitness coach that tracks every PR. A writing partner that knows your characters better than you do. A research assistant that already knows how you work.

BMad Builder lets you create:

- **Personal AI Companions**: Agents with memory that evolve with you over time
- **Domain Experts**: Specialists for any field: legal, medical, creative, technical
- **Workflow Automations**: Structured processes that guide you through complex tasks
- **Custom Modules**: Bundle agents and workflows into shareable packages

## What Makes It Different

| Feature               | Why It Matters                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Persistent Memory** | Agents remember across sessions and keep improving          |
| **Composable**        | Your creations work alongside the entire BMad ecosystem     |
| **Skill-Compliant**   | Built on open standards that work with any AI tool          |
| **Shareable**         | Package and distribute your modules to the BMad community   |

## Quick Start

### 1. Register the Module

On first use, run `bmad-bmb-setup` to register BMad Builder in your project. This collects your preferences (name, language, output paths) and registers the builder's capabilities with the help system so `bmad-help` can guide you.

:::tip[Single-Skill Modules]
If you install a module that contains only one skill, that skill handles its own registration on first run. No separate setup step needed.
:::

### 2. Build Something

Invoke the **Agent Builder** or **Workflow Builder** and describe what you want to create. Both walk you through a series of questions and produce a ready-to-use skill folder.

| Goal                      | Builder          | Menu Code |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| AI companion with memory  | Agent Builder    | BA        |
| Structured process / tool | Workflow Builder | BW        |
| Package skills as module  | Module Builder   | CM        |

### 3. Use Your Skill

The builders produce a complete skill folder. Copy it into your AI tool's skills directory (`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, or wherever your tool looks) and it's immediately usable.

:::tip[Custom Module Installation]
The BMad Method installer supports installing custom modules from any Git host (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted) or local paths. See the [BMad Method install guide](https://docs.bmad-method.org/how-to/install-custom-modules/) for details.
:::

:::tip[No Module Required]
If you're building something for personal use, you don't need to package it as a module. Copy the skill folder and use it directly. Module packaging (with `bmad-help` registration and configuration) is for sharing or richer discoverability.
